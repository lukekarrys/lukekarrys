I'm Luke (he/him) and that's my favorite spot to ride my bike to. I work at GitHub on the [npm](https://github.com/npm) cli team.

**Here are some things that I like to do:**

- ⛰️ go [outside](https://instagram.com/lukes.outside)
- 📷 take [photos](https://photos.lukelov.es)
- 🚴 ride my bike to drink ☕ [coffee](https://lukelov.es/tags/coffeeneuring/)
- 📝 jot down some [thoughts about code](https://lukecod.es)
- 🌐 open source (my code)[https://github.com/lukekarrys?tab=repositories]
- 💻 build weird web stuff:
  - 🏅 [a bracket challenge site](https://bracket.club)
  - 🥠 [an emoji fortune cookie generator](https://emojifortunes.lukecod.es/)
  - 🎵 [a youtube playlist music player](https://livefromquarantine.club/)

Feel free to [reach out](https://lukekarrys.com) about any of the above!
